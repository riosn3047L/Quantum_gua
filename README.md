## Key Features
1. **Maturity Assessment Engine**: Quick (12 questions) and Comprehensive (120 questions) assessments.
2. **Quantum Cryptography Scanners**: TLS Scanner, CryptoScan, and CryptoDeps for vulnerability analysis.
3. **CBOM Generator**: Generate Cryptographic Bills of Materials.
4. **Results & Compliance Dashboard**: NIST PQC, CMMC 2.0, FedRAMP, and FISMA mappings.
5. **AI Chat Advisor**: Integrated Gemini AI for cybersecurity advice.

## 3-Tier Architecture
QuantumGuard employs a highly modular, decoupled 3-Tier Architecture designed for enterprise scalability and security:

    subgraph ClientSide [Client Side / Presentation Tier]
        UI[Browser UI]
        JS[Vanilla JS / UI Logic]
        State[localStorage]
    end

    subgraph ApplicationSide [Application Side / Logic Tier]
        API[Node.js + Express API]
        TLS[TLS Scanner Engine]
        AIProxy[AI Proxy Service]
    end

    subgraph ServerSide [Server Side / Data Tier]
        FileSystem[Server File System]
        DB[(Firebase / Database)]
    end

    ClientSide <-->|HTTP / REST API| ApplicationSide
    ApplicationSide <-->|Read / Write| ServerSide
```

- **Presentation Tier**: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JS. (Client-side UI)
- **Application Tier**: Node.js & Express.js. (Business logic, TLS scanning, AI proxy)
- **Data Tier**: localStorage (Client), File System/Firebase (Server/Storage).

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

## Scoring Methodology
Evaluates readiness across **4 Dimensions**: CVI (Visibility), SGRM (Governance), DPE (Data Protection), and ITR (Technical Readiness). 

- **Scoring Scale**: Each control is evaluated on a 1-4 scale (1 = Non-Existent, 4 = Quantum-Safe).
- **Weakest Link Principle**: A dimension's score is capped by its weakest controls, preventing artificially high averages.
- **Maturity Tiers**: Final scores (1.0 to 4.0) are mapped to a 5-level maturity tier (Basic to Optimizing) to gauge "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" risk.
