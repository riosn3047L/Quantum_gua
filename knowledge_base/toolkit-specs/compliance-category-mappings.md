### CMMC 2.0 Categories

CMMC uses domain-based organization:

**Domains and Practice Codes:**
- **AC** = Access Control (AC.L1, AC.L2, AC.L3)
- **AT** = Awareness and Training

- **SI** = System and Information Integrity
- **SR** = Supply Chain Risk Management

### FISMA/FedRAMP Categories

These use NIST SP 800-53 control families:

Same as CMMC categories above, but with additional detail:
- Each control has a number (e.g., SC-13 = Cryptographic Protection)
- Controls can have enhancements (e.g., SC-13(1), SC-13(2))

### GDPR Categories (When applicable)

GDPR doesn't use numbered categories but rather principles:
- **Article 5** = Principles relating to processing
- **Article 25** = Data protection by design and by default
- **Article 32** = Security of processing
- **Article 33** = Notification of breach
- **Article 35** = Data protection impact assessment

## Question 2: Detailed Mapping Section Structure

**CONFIRMED:** Yes, the Detailed Mapping section should be aggregated for each Practice Area, with **12 rows total** (3 practice areas × 4 dimensions):

### Dimension 1 - Critical Vulnerability Identification (CVI)
1. **Practice 1.1**: Asset Discovery & Classification (Q1-Q10)
2. **Practice 1.2**: Vulnerability Scanning & Analysis (Q11-Q20)
3. **Practice 1.3**: Risk Prioritization & Tracking (Q21-Q30)

### Dimension 2 - Strategic Governance & Risk Management (SGRM)
4. **Practice 2.1**: Governance Structure & Leadership (Q31-Q40)
5. **Practice 2.2**: Risk Management Framework (Q41-Q50)
6. **Practice 2.3**: Compliance & Audit (Q51-Q60)

### Dimension 3 - Data Protection & Encryption (DPE)
7. **Practice 3.1**: Encryption Implementation (Q61-Q70)
8. **Practice 3.2**: Key Management Systems (Q71-Q80)
9. **Practice 3.3**: Data Classification & Handling (Q81-Q90)

### Dimension 4 - Infrastructure & Technical Readiness (ITR)
10. **Practice 4.1**: Network Security Architecture (Q91-Q100)
11. **Practice 4.2**: System Hardening & Updates (Q101-Q110)
12. **Practice 4.3**: Incident Response & Recovery (Q111-Q120)

Each row in the Detailed Mapping would aggregate the compliance scores for all 10 questions within that practice area, showing:
- Practice Area Name
- Average compliance score for each framework
- Number of direct mappings vs. partial mappings
- Key compliance gaps identified
- Priority recommendations

## Additional Notes for Implementation

1. **Weight-based scoring**: Each question has a relevance weight (0.0-1.0) for each framework
2. **Aggregation formula**: Practice Area Score = SUMPRODUCT(Question Scores, Relevance Weights) / SUM(Relevance Weights)
3. **Priority indicators**: Questions with weight ≥ 0.8 are HIGH priority for that framework
4. **Special frameworks**: 
   - NIST PQC only applies to cryptography-related questions
   - CMMC levels (L1, L2, L3) indicate increasing maturity requirements
   - FedRAMP inherits all FISMA controls plus additional requirements
