## Compliance Scoring Methodology

### Mapping Strength Indicators

Each QuantumGuard practice question is mapped to compliance requirements using the following strength indicators:

- **Direct Mapping** (●●●): QuantumGuard practice directly satisfies the compliance requirement
- **Strong Mapping** (●●○): QuantumGuard practice substantially addresses the requirement with minor gaps
- **Partial Mapping** (●○○): QuantumGuard practice partially addresses the requirement
- **Supporting** (○○○): QuantumGuard practice provides supporting evidence but doesn't directly satisfy

### Compliance Coverage Calculation

```
Compliance Score = (Direct × 1.0 + Strong × 0.75 + Partial × 0.5 + Supporting × 0.25) / Total Requirements
```

### Evidence Collection

For each mapped requirement, organizations should collect:
1. **Policy Documentation**: Showing governance and management commitment
2. **Technical Evidence**: Configuration files, scan results, architecture diagrams
3. **Process Evidence**: Procedures, workflows, change records
4. **Testing Evidence**: Assessment results, validation reports, remediation tracking

---

## Using This Mapping

### For Compliance Teams
1. Use mappings to identify which QuantumGuard practices support specific compliance requirements
2. Generate compliance-specific reports using QuantumGuard assessment results
3. Identify gaps where additional controls may be needed

### For Implementation Teams
1. Prioritize QuantumGuard practices that satisfy multiple compliance requirements
2. Use evidence requirements to guide documentation efforts
3. Align technical implementations with compliance needs

### For Auditors
1. Reference mappings to understand how QuantumGuard supports compliance objectives
2. Use QuantumGuard maturity scores as indicators of control effectiveness
3. Review evidence collection aligned with mapped requirements
